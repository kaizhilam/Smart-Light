# Smart-Light

## SIT314 - Final Project

### Using my Pixel repository as base

## Getting started

### Prerequisite
- Python 3.6 and above

### Instructions
1. Launch [building.pyw](building.pyw) to simulate lights in building. Wait for it to populate.
2. Launch [interface.pyw](interface.pyw) to simulate web app or mobile app.
3. Launch [switch.pyw](switch.pyw) to simulate physical switch. (Still uses MQTT to communicate because it's a simulation)

## Note
The reason it takes a while to launch is because populating lightbulb isn't running parallel.

But the system will run close to parallel when it is done populating
